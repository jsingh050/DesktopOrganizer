# DesktopOrganizer
This code will sort the files on your desktop by category and by type. I love the feeling of doing some spring cleaning, and this is a way to help automate that process! You could also link this to google collab to organize your google drive folders. 

This is pretty easy to customize based on your needs! This script automatically organizes all your files into folders based on:
- Subjects: I chose some like Math, Science, History, Resume, Taxes, Lab Work
-  File Type (Documents, Images, Videos, Applications, Music, etc.)
-  It also deals with duplicate file types by renaming files to include a timestamp.

You can edit the subjects based on your needs. It should leave pre-sorted folders alone. I have inlcuded a video that shows how it worked on my desktop in this repo. Enjoy some spring cleaning!
